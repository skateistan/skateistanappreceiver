# skateistanappreceiver

Skateistan uses Highrise to manage all contacts including all intern/remote volunteer applicants.

Skateistan receives intern/remote volunteer applications via its Drupal-powered website.

This Sinatra app receives the applications from the Skateistan website and uses the Highrise API to create contacts into Highrise.

The webform_skateistan_apps directory is a Drupal module which provides webform submission functionality specific to the Skateistan application forms.
