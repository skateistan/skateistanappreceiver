# Skateistan Application Receiver

Skateistan receives [international](http://skateistan.org/international-volunteer-application) and [remote](http://www.skateistan.org/volunteer-from-your-home-country) volunteer applications via its website.

This app is a webhook receiver which receives these applications from the Skateistan website and currently uses the Campaign Monitor API to add subscribers to a list in Skateistan's Campaign Monitor account.
