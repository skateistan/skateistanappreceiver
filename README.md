# skateistanappreceiver

Skateistan uses Highrise to manage all contacts including all intern/remote volunteer applicants.

Skateistan receives intern/remote volunteer applications via Google forms connected to spreadsheets.

This Sinatra app receives the applications from Google Apps Script (useful shit) connected to the spreadsheets and uses the Highrise API to create contacts into Highrise.
